# ICS-Quadratic-Grader--CHIWUSWA-JOSEPH-
This is a simple html 5  program written with JavaScript and CSS that solves Quadratic equations by accepting variables A, B &amp; C (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) and a Grading System for Mulungushi University that Accepts numerical values and turn it into grades (A+, A, B+, B, C+, C &amp;D) with the described ranges
**the two parts of this Program are futher explained below:**
**1) Quadratic Solver  **
• Inputs: three number fields for a, b, c with labels. 
• Validation: 
o a ≠ 0; all inputs must be valid numbers. 
o Show clear, friendly error messages near the inputs. 
• Calculations to show: 
o Discriminant (D = b^2 - 4ac). 
o Nature of roots: 
▪ (D > 0) → two distinct real roots 
▪ (D = 0) → one real repeated root 
▪ (D < 0) → two complex conjugate roots 
• Output: neatly formatted results (values to a sensible number of decimal places). 
• Include a Reset/Clear button. 
2) Grading System 
• Input: one number field for Score (integer 0–100). 
• Validation: only numbers in [0, 100]; show an error if out of range or empty. 
• Output: the letter grade based on the scale above and a short message, e.g., 
o “Score 82 → Grade A” 
o Edge cases must be correct (e.g., 85 → A+, 75 → A, 65 → B+, 60 → B, 55 → 
C+, 50 → C, 49 → D, 100 → A+, 0 → D).
